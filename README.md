# 📈 E-Commerce Sales Performance Dashboard: Online Retail Analysis

This project features a comprehensive data analysis of the **Online Retail Transaction Dataset** to construct a **Sales Performance Dashboard** using Power BI. The analysis focuses on transforming raw, inconsistent data into actionable insights for driving growth and mitigating significant profit risks.

## 📌 Project Overview
The project aims to analyze e-commerce transaction data and build a **Sales Performance Dashboard**.

The analysis focused on:
- Measuring sales performance (Revenue, AOV, Customer, Return Rate).
- Understanding purchasing patterns (time, seasonality, country).
- Evaluating promotional effectiveness & pricing strategies.
- Identifying top performers & return risks.

## 🎯 Key Metrics & Results
| Metric | Value | Insight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Revenue** | **€9.7M** | Strong sales volume. |
| **Average Order Value (AOV)** | **€380** | Stable purchasing basket size. |
| **Return Rate** | **~40%** | Critical profit risk (UK is the largest contributor). |
| **Promo Sales Contribution** | **~2%** | Untapped potential for growth. |
| **Key Pattern** | **Q4 Seasonality & 10:00-15:00 Peak** | Opportunity for time-based campaigns. |

## 🚀 Business Impact & Recommendations
| Impact Area | Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **High Profit Risk (~40% Return)** | Focus on lowering the return rate via quality control and clearer product descriptions. |
| **Low Promotional Effectiveness** | Strengthen strategy using time-based and seasonal campaigns. |
| **Revenue Optimization** | Optimize portfolio: balance low-cost volume drivers with premium profit drivers. |
| **Market Strategy** | Employ localized strategies for international markets and improve **CustomerID** capture for deep customer analysis. |
